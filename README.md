# Project Description

Automated species identification is a method of discrimination of biological objects and/or
groups (e.g. species) via artificial intelligence. Today, most automated identification systems
rely on images depicting the species for the identification. Once exposed to a sufficient amount
of training data, the classifier can identify the species on previously unseen images. As opposed
to such approach, this project deals with an automatic species identification based on their
vocalization. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are used as features for the training
and test datasets. Voices of 4 different families, 8 genus, and 10 species of frogs are analysed.
The task is to use a machine learning classifier for recognition of families, genus and species of
frogs.

We use already labeled data set by MFCC, this project is focused on the classification. Following the paper, a Decision tree is implemented.
